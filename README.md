# POS Interface for Selling Fitness Plans

## Overview
This project is a **Point of Sale (POS) Interface** designed for selling fitness plans and services, such as fitness classes, therapy sessions, and workshops. The application provides an intuitive, responsive, and functional frontend that simplifies service selection, cart management, and checkout processes. The project showcases coding skills, product development capabilities, and solution design for real-world contexts.

## Features

2. **Add to Cart**: Services can be added to a cart with options to view and edit cart details.
3. **Customer Management**: Users can optionally add customer details, such as name, email, and phone, during checkout.
4. **Payments**: Simulated payment flow for checkout (mock payments, no real integrations).
5. **Receipt Generation**: Generate and display a receipt with transaction details upon successful checkout.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with optional use of frameworks like React or Vue.js)
